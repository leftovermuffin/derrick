I love Bukowski and his writing. Well as I am somewhat acquainted with his works, I know what kind of people he likes and whom he despises. I am in the second category. Well, I love his writing style nonetheless, and of course the brilliantly built up charecters. The straightforward easy to read chapters can be  run over effortlessly. Yet sometimes some heavenly blend words make you stare at them for some good five minutes and wonder what a genius this guy was. 
Henry Chinaski is a strange, utterly antisocial self isolated rebel. Yet he has a heart that gets warm in some unexpected moments. It's portrayed so beautifully how each turn of event shaped each part of his mind. 
It's a beautiful book about struggle in american down-to-earth urban life and about a kid's becoming a man through it.
