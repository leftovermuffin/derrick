I started reading this book for a long time- long before all these COVID-19 breakout. Put the book aside many times. Quarantine boredom is the main reason that made me finish this book, I guess. I guess it sums up the fact je I am not a big fan of this book! ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…

Gulzar sahib is a prominent lyricist in Bollywood. I have liked the way he uses Urdu and Hindi words in the glamour-striken world of Indian Cinema. So when I found out he writes too, I was really interested to give it a try. Also the title has its fair share to raise curiosity.

**Half a Rupee Stories** is basically a collection of short stories- consisting 25 stories divided into 8 parts, each having a motif of it's own. It has some stories about his personal life, some based on situations in India and others. It's a fat book- almost 207 pages! And maybe I found it longer because of the predictable outcome of almost every story. Well my expectations about Gulzar as a writer was a bit high, I guess. The  book couldn't meet it.

Almost of stories in this book have  a certain pattern of ending (with some sort of twist-even when it's not needed) which is a bit frustrating.  Especially if you are a reader who likes to finish a book in one go, it's a no-no. No proper closure is given to most of them and they fail miserably in every attempt to woo your soul. I don't know whether to blame the translation for this. Though some of the stories may make you smile, but mostly they didn't do justice to the context. So I feel a bit heartbroken!
