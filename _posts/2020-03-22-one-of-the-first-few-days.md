It's not actually the first day of my quarantine life. I have been locked down inside my house since yesterday. But still, I will follow the sunday-being-the-first-day-of-week thing.

I was sick since last couple of days. Sneezing, sore throat, coughing. Classic signs of COVID-19.
Having AID, it's extremely tough for me to keep my calm while noticing these symptoms on myself. And that's exactly what I did, went frenzy. I worried and cried and made everyone so disturbed- now I feel a bit bad about it. 

Anyways, today was my first work from home experience. It was pretty neat, I could get uplate and have my usual breakdown and yet attended office. Even completed my tasks within time, yay! Later on, made myself some tea, attended a group call with oversees bosses, took a nap afterwards. Felt pretty good after getting up, so pumped that I made some desserts! After how the morning went, it's pretty great to have a smooth finishing.

After getting up today while I was sneezing and coughing and everyone including my mum was keeping a distance from me- it felt strange. I could actually feel like I have grown up and have to take the responsibility of my deeds completely- no one will be there for me. And I must say, it made me a bit more mature, and maybe-maybe shaped my future somehow.
